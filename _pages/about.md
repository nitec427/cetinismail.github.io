Hello, my name is Ismail Cetin. I am currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Computer Science and working as an AI Researcher at Koc University. For the past one and a half years, I have been employed at Rem People. Prior to this, I worked as an Undergraduate Researcher at the Computer Vision Lab at Istanbul Technical University (ITU). I earned my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from ITU.
